Odin Project's rock paper sisscor project. I will be using functions to create a simple rock paper sisscor game where a human plays against the computer.
This isn't the prettiest thing in the world but my css knowledge is limited at this point in time. I hope that pretty soon Ill be able to make projects like this with more beautiful UI's and nice animiations.
